# adeno-periphery

This is the repo for the Adeno token's peripheral contracts. Those that, directly or indirectly, interact with the Adeno token.

These contracts and tests were developed using the Foundry toolkit, which can be found at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry.

Once you have Foundry installed, clone the adeno-periphery repo, and navigate to the `adeno-periphery` directory.

In order to run the tests, run `forge test --fork-url x`, where x is the url of your Ethereum mainnet node. This can, for example, be an infura or alchemy url.

The above command will first compile the contracts and should install any missing dependencies, before running the tests.
